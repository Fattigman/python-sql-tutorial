# Python + SQLAlchemy primer
This is meant as an easy primer to how to write databases with python and sqlalchemy.

This is meant as a tutorial for my colleagues

Start reading at main.py and work your way up the spider web.

To run the project do the following, preferrably in your favorite virtual environment tool:
```bash 
git clone https://github.com/Fattigman/python-sql-tutorial
cd python-sql-tutorial
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

You can also check the various docs I have created for simpler examples.
## Good to know
These are a collection of small docs that I have written regarding SQL with pythong. Note that they are vertical in that they build upon eachother.
